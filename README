# Reusable Web Components
Currently only one component here, actually it's a proof of concept. 
Using a bit modified and standalone version of Meteor's Blaze.
One of additional functions Blaze.loadTemplate async loads templates and compiles it.
So template files can be live in separate places.

# TODO
testing!!!
use require/common js
use package manager
